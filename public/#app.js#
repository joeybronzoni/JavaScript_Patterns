// What is a Pattern?
/* 
   - A reusable solution that can be applied tgo occuring problems in software design (JS apps)
   - Can aslo be though of as programming templates
   - Situations vary significantly 

   - What patterns we will look at: 
     -Module & Revealing Module Patterns:
	   - used for overall structure, allows us to break our code up into modules where we can have 
	   private and public functions & variables
	   - *note about modules: in ES6/ES2015 introduced actual modules in JavaScript, meaning that we can use seperate files 
	   to export modules which are just custom peices of code and import them into a file. 
	     -this is not supported in browsers so babel and/or webpack is needed to compile it down
	   - In Es5 we have the Module pattern that allows us to break up our code into self contained modules
	   with private properties(variables) and methods(functions) 
	   
	 
	 -Singleton:
	   - a variation of the Module pattern where we can only create 1 instance of an object 

	 -Factory: 
	   - used to create many many objects 

	 -Observer:
	   - allows us to subscribe and unsubscribe to events

	 -Mediator:
	   - has a central mediator and colleages that seperate off of it

	 -State: 
	   - allows us to have a certain state and we can change that state
